### 🔹 Prerequisites  
Ensure your system has the following is installed:  
- **Windows OS** (Windows 10/11 or Windows Server)  
- [**.NET Framework 4.8**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48)  
- [**MS SQL Server (2016 or later)**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)  
- **IIS Express or IIS Server**  
- [**Visual Studio 2019/2022**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (with ASP.NET development workload) or another compatible IDE   

### 🔹 Technology Stack  
This project uses:  
- **Backend:** ASP.NET MVC (.NET Framework 4.8.1)  
- **Database:** MS SQL Server, Azure Table Storage  
- **File/Blob Storage:** Azure Blob Storage  

### 🔹 Running the Project Locally  

#### 1️⃣ Set Up the Database  
- Locate SQL scripts in [`/src/JicoDotNet.SQLServer/DefaultScript`](/src/JicoDotNet.SQLServer/DefaultScript) folder.  
- Execute [`AllSchemaScript.sql`](/src/JicoDotNet.SQLServer/DefaultScript/AllSchemaScript.sql) to create database schema.  
- Execute [`BasicDefaultData.sql`](/src/JicoDotNet.SQLServer/DefaultScript/BasicDefaultData.sql) to insert default required data.  

#### 2️⃣ Build & Run the Project  
- Open the [solution](/src/JicoDotNet.Inventory.sln) in **Visual Studio**.  
- Set the startup project and build the solution.  
- Run the project – it will be available at **`http://localhost:12345/`**.  
- If port **12345** is occupied, modify the port `<IISUrl>` in the `.csproj` file.  

#### 3️⃣ Configuration File Samples  

You need to change **Configuration details** in in the [`Web.config`](/src/JicoDotNet.Inventory.UI/Web.config) file.

- For **Sql Server Database**, the connection string is stored under the key:  

```xml
<appSettings>
    <add key="SqlServerConnection" value="YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING_GOES_HERE" />
</appSettings>
```

- For **Azure Table & Blob Storage**, the connection string is stored under the key:  

> _Generate the connection string of **Azure Table Storage** from [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)._

> To generate an Azure Table Storage connection string from the Azure Portal, follow these steps:  
> 1. Navigate to your **storage account** in the Azure Portal.  
> 2. In the **Security + networking** section, locate the Access keys setting.  
> 3. Click on the **Show keys** button at the top of the page to display the account keys and associated connection strings.  
> 4. Copy the **Connection String** from Key1 or Key2.  
> 5. Add this to the project's **Web.config**  

```xml
<appSettings>
    <add key="AzureStorageConnection" value="YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING_GOES_HERE" />
</appSettings>
```

### 🔹 Deployment Guide (Windows & Azure)
#### Windows Server Deployment
🔹 Publish the project from Visual Studio.   
🔹 Configure IIS to host the application.   
🔹 Ensure MS SQL Server & storage configurations are set.   

#### Azure Deployment
🔹 Deploy as an Azure Web App (Windows-based).   
🔹 Use Azure Table Storage & Blob Storage configurations.   
🔹 Ensure SQL Server is hosted on Azure or connected via Azure SQL.
